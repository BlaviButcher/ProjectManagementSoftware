# ProjectManagementSoftware
Management software for a company creating applications for clients. Uses C#, Winforms and SQL

Was a big project. Totaled over 80 hours from scratch. There were 3 parts to the assignment.
* Part 1 - Planning, building the ER diagrams and relational tables/models.
* Part 2 - Building the database and a small implementation with C#
* Part 3 - Full implementation


It is assumed that the projects are already created by the CEO. Further implementation for CEO would be nice.
