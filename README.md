# ProjectManagementSoftware
Management software for a company creating applications for clients. Uses C#, Winforms and SQL

Was a big project. Totaled over 80 hours from scratch. There were 3 parts to the assignment.
* Part 1 - Planning, building the ER diagrams and relational tables/models.
* Part 2 - Building the database and a small implementation with C#
* Part 3 - Full implementation

## A refined list of what the application can do
### Managers
* View projects they're assigned to
* Add and update tasks for project
* Assign programmers to tasks
* View task progress
* Create, view and update project issues associated with projects/tasks they are working on

### Programmers
* Create and view project issues associated with projects/tasks they are working on
* View tasks they're assigned to
* View task progress

### Managers and Programmers
* Summary reports (real basic)

Note: It is assumed that the projects are already created by the CEO. Further implementation for CEO would be nice.
